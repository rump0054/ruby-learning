# Showing the slides

We use a Ruby app called `deck.rb` to generate and serve the slides.

    gem install deckrb
    
After installing, run

    deck *.md

This will launch a local Sinatra server on port 4333. Open your browser to `localhost:4333`. On a Mac you can run:

    open http://localhost:4333

Use arrow keys to navigate slides. Press '?' to see a help window.

# Editing slides

Slides are in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) format. Showoff will read all `.md` files in alphabetical order.

You can also add custom `.css`, `.scss`, and `.js` files, which will get imported into all slide sections.

Images should be in, or relative to, the directory that the source markdown file is in.
