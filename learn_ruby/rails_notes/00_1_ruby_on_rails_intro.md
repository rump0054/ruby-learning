# Rails Philosophy

* Opinionated
* Convention over configuration
* DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
  * Less code means it's easier to maintain & modify
* Test Driven Development (TDD)
* "Low in ceremony"
  * Minimal code - maximal effect
  
# Rails Architecture

* Generators and Scaffolding
* MVC (Model/View/Controller pattern)
* RESTy routes
* Active Record ORM
  * including migrations!
  * DB agnostic

# How You Will Learn

* Exploration: experiment, play
* Test-Driven Development (TDD)
  * Initially as a learning methodology
  * Later as a development methodology
* Ask questions
* Learn to find your own answers

# It Works Best, When...

* Active participation
* Try something new
* Team Effort
  * Pairing

# Tool Chain

* Linux/Mac/Windows
* git -- revision control
* RVM -- Ruby version manager
* rubygems and Bundler -- Ruby libraries & management
* rake -- maintenance tasks
* ruby -- programming language
* RSpec -- testing framework
* Rails -- framework

# Help! So much new stuff?!

* Many new technologies and tools
* But:
  * They are designed to let you be productive when you know only a little
  * Deeper understanding unlocks more power, but is not a prerequisite to accomplish something
* Strong generalists over narrowly-focused experts
* Breadth over depth
